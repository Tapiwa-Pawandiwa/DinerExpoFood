The meat is usually seasoned with curry powder, turmeric, and other spices, and the dried fruit (often raisins or apricots) adds a sweet and tangy flavor to the dish. Bobotie is often served with yellow rice, which is typically made with turmeric and raisins, and chutney on the side. It is a delicious and hearty meal that is popular both in South Africa and around the world.", "hostID": "3072fd60-c3d7-4b9c-ae5e-79bb3681f4d4", "id": "6c3d6f9c-8b1b-40a4-9b73-ccd32a4127d2", "imageURI": "https://dinerapp-storage-2666d9f7135215-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/Food/African/South+Africa/bobotie-jpg--64975-.jpg", "ingredients": ["Ground Beef", "Rice", "Raisins", "Dried Fruit", "bread", "chutney"], "name": "Bobotie", "plates": 3, "price": 12, "tags": ["Beef", "African"], "time": "10:45", "updatedAt": "2023-02-25T18:28:14.696Z"}
